      <h1>Antonio Gaudi</h1>
      <p>The voices of Barcelona blur in a mix of Spanish and Catalan in much the way Gaudi's work blurs the lines between architecture and artwork.</p>
      <p>From the tiled benches in Guell Park to the towers over Casa Mila and Casa Battlo, I fell in love with Goudi's work on my first trip to Barcelona.</p>

    <h1>Park Guell</h1>
    <p>The benches as Lizard fountain in Park Guell make up part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site know as, "The works of Antonio Gauni."</p>
    <p>The park features Gaudi's famous Lizard Fountain, as well as benches and other extraordinary examples of Gaudi's talent with tiles.</p>

      <h1>Casa Batllo</h1>
    <p>The first time I strolled down the Passeig de Gracia (Catalan for the Promenade of Grace), I stopped in my track in front of Gaudi's Casa Batllo.</p>
    <p>The "house," wedged between two ' normal buildings, looks more like a giant sculpture than my house i'd ever seen anywhere else.</p>

  <section class="Mila">
    <div class="mila-text">
      <h1>Casa Mila</h1>
    <p>A populaar attraction in Barcelona, Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera, is arguably one of the most famous buildings designed by Gaudi.</p>
    <p>The roof features a collection of chimneys and towers that like they'd fit right in as characters in a Dr. Suess book.</p>
